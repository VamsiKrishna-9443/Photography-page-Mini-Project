🚀✨ Mini Project Milestone Unlocked! 🎉🌟 Portfolio Project Highlight: Beginner Photo App with Sidebar Navigation 📸🧑‍💻

Excited to showcase one of my first portfolio projects – a Photo Gallery Web App featuring a clean Sidebar Navigation UI and responsive design!
This project helped me strengthen my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and taught me how to structure and style a beginner-level web application effectively. 🎯✨

🚀 It's a small but meaningful step in my journey to become a Full Stack Developer. Every line of code written here is a step toward bigger projects and deeper understanding. 💻📚

💡 Key Features:

* Responsive Sidebar Menu 📂
* Clean layout for displaying images 🖼
* Beginner-friendly and scalable for future enhancements 🔧

🙏 A huge thanks to @Shradha Khapra mam for her continuous inspiration and clear guidance. Your mentorship means the world! 🌟💖
